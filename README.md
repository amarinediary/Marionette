## Elastic Beanstalk environement
|-|Parameters|
|-|-|
|Platform|`Node.js`|
|Platform branch|`Node.js 14 running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2`|
|Tested up to platform version|`5.4.7 (Recommended)`|

## Backward compatibility
The Marionette Puppeteer deployment folder has been successfully tested with AWS Elastic Beanstalk on a `Node.js 12 running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2` environement.

## Quick start
Clone this repository, and use it as your deployement folder:

1. `git clone https://github.com/amarinediary/Marionette.git`

Initiate your new project and install dependencies:

2. `npm init --y`
3. `npm i puppeteer --save`

## `.npmrc` file
The `.npmrc` file defines how `npm` should behave when running commands. Setting `unsafe-perm` to `true` suppress the UID/GID switching when running package scripts. Set the `unsafe-perm` flag to run scripts with root privileges.
- Source @ https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/config#unsafe-perm

## `.ebextensions` folder
You can add AWS Elastic Beanstalk configuration files (`.ebextensions`) to your web application's source code to configure your environment and customize the AWS resources that it contains.

In our case, if we don't enable [EPEL](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL#What_is_Extra_Packages_for_Enterprise_Linux_.28or_EPEL.29.3F) and if we continue installing chromium as part of `npm install`, Puppeteer cannot launch Chromium due to the unavailability of `libatk-1.0.so.0`.

## Deployment folder structure
```
app/
├── .ebextensions/
│   ├── 01_enableEPEL.config
│   └── 02_installEPELPackages.config
├── .npmrc
...
```

## Dumb mistakes
If your deployment isn't working you should always try to look at the log file from your Elastic Beanstalk environment.
A common mistake is packages mismatch between your local environment and your Elastic Beanstalk environment. Make sure both environment match.
